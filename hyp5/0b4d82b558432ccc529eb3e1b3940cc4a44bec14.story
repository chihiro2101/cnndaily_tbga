A new model for HIV progression shows that it spreads in
progression from HIV to AIDS in
it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system can not function correctly
recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below
and our model shows that HIV spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause AIDS
