UEFA 's general secretary Gianni Infantino has warned that there will be no choice but to suspend Greece from international football unless the country 's government rescinds proposed new laws
UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece
but UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino says they are not allowed to directly interfere with football
` Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference
meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League
