So who will be voted PFA Player of the Year
Eden Hazard is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank
I 'm sure Hazard and the other leading contenders -- in my mind David de Gea and Harry Kane -- will benefit from their team-mates being careful with who they vote for
The Belgium international has been in superb form for Jose Mourinho 's side as they look set to win the title
I feel De Gea will miss out on becoming the first goalkeeper to win PFA Player of the Year since Pat Jennings in 1976
