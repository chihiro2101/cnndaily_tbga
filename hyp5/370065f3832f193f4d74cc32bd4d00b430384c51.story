Saudi jets began airstrikes in Yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom 's Washington ambassador described as `` restoring the legitimate government '' and protecting
the American decision to stand behind the Saudi attack on Yemen can best be described as misguided
then it must be acknowledged that the Saudi war on Yemen will not only undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen
The reality is that Saudi and Gulf Co-operation Council jets are effectively acting as al Qaeda 's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al Qaeda from several Yemeni regions
