The football purists are foaming at the mouth -- how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football
Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea 's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United
I 'm no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United
and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion -- by not wanting possession of the football
But do n't judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone
