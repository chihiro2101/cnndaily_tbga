The West Indies believe they now dominate England captain Alastair Cook whose nightmare start to the series saw him fail in both innings of the first Test
England finished on 116-3 to lead by 220 runs at the end of the third day in Antigua with seven second-innings wickets standing
But the hosts are jubilant that struggling Cook has twice fallen cheaply to the plan of bowling at him full and swinging around off stump
Alastair Cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first Test in Antigua
James Tredwell earlier picked up four wickets as England bowled West Indies out for 295 in their first innings
