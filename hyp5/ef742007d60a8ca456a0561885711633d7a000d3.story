A Virginia man has won the right to see his son
. Robert Preston Boardwine provided his friend Joyce Rosemary Bruce with sperm and she impregnated herself using the kitchen accessory in 2010
She had opted for the bizarre method of conception because she believed that the absence of intercourse would mean Mr Boardwine had no parental rights
the pair disagreed on the level of involvement Mr Boardwine would have in his son 's life
Ms Bruce can still appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court .
