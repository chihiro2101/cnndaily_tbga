Samantha Cameron showcased another election campaign outfit this morning
thoroughly British outfit at the Conservative Party 's manifesto launch in Swindon
Mrs Cameron looked every inch the First Lady of British politics as she arrived at the town 's University Technical Colleges
Samantha laughs at one of the Prime Minister 's more jovial points
but if Mrs Cameron went up against Justine Miliband she surges to 38 per cent with Labour on 30 per cent
