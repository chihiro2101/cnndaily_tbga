Prague 's international airport has been forced to hire porters to carry passengers
A new metro line extension opened this week in the Czech capital -- transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before -- but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses does n't have
luggage up and down the stairs at Nadrazi Veleslavin station every day
the No 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between Vaclav Havel Airport and the nearest metro station
' An escalator was built for airport customers but it connects the metro station and an unbuilt train station
