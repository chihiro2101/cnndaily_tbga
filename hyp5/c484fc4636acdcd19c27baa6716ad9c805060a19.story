will always remember when things turned
peaceful demonstration in downtown Miami near the courthouse
The immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of Dr. King were police action
My parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement
both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots
