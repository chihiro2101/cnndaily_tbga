If you live in the UK or US you can expect to have already been hacked -- at least according to the real life conman turned fraud prevention expert whose escapades inspired Catch Me If You Can
whose early life on the run from the FBI was brought to life on the screen by Leonardo Di Caprio
Frank Abagnale -LRB- right -RRB- has said individuals in the western world have probably already had their identities stolen
However the former conman changed his ways and has spent the rest of his career working with the FBI on fraud detection and prevention
2.5 million he took was recovered by the U.S. Government and he has spent 40 years helping catch criminals
