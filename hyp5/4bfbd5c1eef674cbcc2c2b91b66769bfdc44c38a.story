of sand and patterned stripes in an area known as the Erg Chech
Linear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles -LRB- 160km -RRB-
He said Professor Hanna compared data on the spacing of linear dunes with the expected dimensions of helical roll vortices in subtropical desert areas
and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel
