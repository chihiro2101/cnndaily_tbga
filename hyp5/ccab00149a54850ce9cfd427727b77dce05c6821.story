A chameleon balances carefully on
It is the work of Italian artist Johannes Stoetter
Italian artist Johannes Stoetter has painted two naked women to look like
Stoetter daubed water-based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect
Stoetter can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it
