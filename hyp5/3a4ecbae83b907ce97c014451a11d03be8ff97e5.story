Chelsea could move for Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda in the summer
The club 's technical director Michael Emenalo travelled to Spain on Saturday to watch the defender during Atletico 's 2-2 draw with Malaga
The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract and Atletico are reportedly keen to cash in this summer
but both clubs are more interested in the Brazilian 's team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez
Chelsea and Atletico held talks over Miranda last summer when Jose Mourinho 's side moved to sign Diego Costa and Felipe Luis
