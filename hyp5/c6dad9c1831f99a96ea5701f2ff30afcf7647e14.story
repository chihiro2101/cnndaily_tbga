Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists keeping Kevin Mirallas happy is key to holding on to him in the summer
There has been plenty of speculation about the Belgium international and he even admitted himself in February he fancied
new challenge and had an ambition to play in the Champions League next season
Injuries have prevented the 27-year-old from really finding his best form this campaign with
run of consistent performances but Martinez was delighted to see him score his first Premier League goal since December 28 in last weekend 's win over Burnley
