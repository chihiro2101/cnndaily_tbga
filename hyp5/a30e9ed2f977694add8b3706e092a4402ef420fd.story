are tiny settlements of people who have adapted to live around nature
these dwellings are hidden away from the rest of the world
Only 16 people live in this tiny village nestled high on the cliffs near the coast of the Faroe Islands
the hidden village is perfectly situated for panoramic views of the Verdon gorge
Secluded from the world are the Uros Islands in Lake Titicaca Puno which sits on the border of Peru and Bolivia
