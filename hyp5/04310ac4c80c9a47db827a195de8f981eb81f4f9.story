Aitor Karanka 's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford
Lee Tomlin -LRB- centre -RRB- scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough 's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday
returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez 's hands
shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro 's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season
But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford 's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post
