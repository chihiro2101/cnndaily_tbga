Tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in South America
the tiny fishing village of Jose Ignacio is almost unknown around the world
Staying in shabby chic cottages or sleek hotels overlooking the sea
what has brought everyone from Colombian singer Shakira to Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood and restaurateur and playboy Giuseppe Cipriani
the capital Montevideo and the glorious colonial Portuguese town of Colonia
