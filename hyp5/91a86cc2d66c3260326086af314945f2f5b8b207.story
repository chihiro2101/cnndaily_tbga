computer can use similar facial flushes to recognise people who have had one drink too many
Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers
The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober -LRB- left -RRB- and drunken images -LRB- right -RRB- pixel-by-pixel -LRB-
the database was made by researchers from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink
They found they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent
