JT 's NEVER BEEN BETTER
Jose Mourinho 's return was the answer to John Terry 's prayers
Mourinho said Sunday 's game at the Emirates was the best Terry had ever played
real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever
He was always able to anticipate where Arsenal wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it
