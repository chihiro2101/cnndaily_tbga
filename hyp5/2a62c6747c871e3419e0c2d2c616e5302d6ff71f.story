children 's feet will often grow faster than it is possible to buy them new shoes to keep them shod
came up with the idea while working in Nairobi in Kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small
pair of shoes where they could just adjust their shoes any time their feet grow
Mr Lee is working with an organisation called Because International which aims to send the shoes to orphanages in Africa
Mr Lee had been working with 140 Aids orphans at the Motherly Care Children 's Home in Nairobi
