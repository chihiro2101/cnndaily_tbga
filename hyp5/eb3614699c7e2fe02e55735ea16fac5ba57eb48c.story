Many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of Marvel 's Tony Stark
but we can now at least get his trademark hi-tech gloves at home
working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer 's palm
His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet/Arm are available to order in varying wavelengths
The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand
