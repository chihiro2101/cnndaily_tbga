Britain 's biggest purpose-built air raid shelter
was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets
The tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the River Mersey in Stockport in the 1930s
and were originally intended to provide car parking spaces
the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of Lancashire and Cheshire could hide from Nazi bombs
