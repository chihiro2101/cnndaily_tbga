Amber Phillips of Los Angeles expressed her support for the right to die law introduced in California on Tuesday that if passed next year will legalize physician assisted suicide for terminally ill patients
` The pain and suffering took some of her dignity away when she became so ill that she was not able to work
but she was unable to spend the final moments with her family because her two sons Owen and Ethan Phillips were on other sides of the country at the time
' Phillips says she is aware that some groups fear that this law could cause abuse for people with disabilities but said there are measures in the law to prevent that from happening
