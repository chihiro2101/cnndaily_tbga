Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday 's Manchester derby at Old Trafford
With plenty at stake for both United and City -- both sides are challenging for
top-four spot in the Premier League -- some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub
Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side
` That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures
