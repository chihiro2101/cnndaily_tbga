After another barmy day in the Championship we are still no closer to finding out which three clubs will be promoted to the Premier League
there have been some stellar individual performances this season that will no doubt have attracted top flight attention
that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not
Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season
cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves do n't go up
