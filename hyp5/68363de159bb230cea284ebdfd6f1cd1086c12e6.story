Designed for future aircraft which will be used by the likes of Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines
Boeing said the redesigned bins can hold six standard-sized bags -- two more than the current set-up
planes will hold 174 -LRB- compared to 118 -RRB- and the 737-700 or 737 MAX
So far two airlines -- Delta and Alaska -- have ordered the new bins
Monarch Airlines and Thomson Airways have committed to order dozens of 737 MAX aircraft
