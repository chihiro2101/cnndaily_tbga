Ed Miliband today refused to guarantee that Harriet Harman would become Deputy Prime Minister if Labour wins the general election
Just hours before the party launched its women 's manifesto
The snub comes just three days after Miss Harman made clear that she intended to take the role were Labour to make it back into power
Miss Harman has previously suggested that Gordon Brown 's refusal in 2007 to maker her Deputy PM was sexist
