Welcome to the exoplanet HD 189733b
where temperatures reach 3,000 째C -LRB- 5,400 째F -RRB- and winds are in excess of 620mph -LRB- 1,000 km/h -RRB-
. The scientists found that the temperature on the planet increases dramatically with altitude -- up to 3,000 째C -LRB- 5,400 째F -RRB- in the upper atmosphere
gas-giant slightly larger than Jupiter -LRB- left -RRB- located 600 trillion kilometres from Earth
The planet -LRB- shown -RRB- was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that Mercury is to our sun
