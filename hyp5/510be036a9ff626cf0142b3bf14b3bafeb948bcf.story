Nico Rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career
Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock
he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton
His attachment to Rosberg is such that he moved from Williams to Mercedes at the driver 's request
