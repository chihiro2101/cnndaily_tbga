Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have brutally beheaded four men accused of theft
before displaying their bodies on railings in
the photographs show four men being interviewed by the terrorists before they are dragged before bloodthirsty crowds eager to see their executions
which typically sees the accused having their right hand hacked-off by machete-wielding jihadis who pump the men full of drugs to numb the limb before severing it from the victim 's body
that could be one explanation for why they were given considerably harsher punishments than those usually received by ordinary citizens accused of similar crimes
