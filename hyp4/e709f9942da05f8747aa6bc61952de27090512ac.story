Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- President Barack Obama says he is `` absolutely committed to making sure '' Israel maintains
His comments to The New York Times
come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran
Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu 's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and does n't `` have the luxury of testing these propositions '' in the deal
But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran wo n't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country 's leadership is n't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are
