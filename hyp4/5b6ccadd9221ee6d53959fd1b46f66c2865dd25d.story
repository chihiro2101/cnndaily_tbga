Now new research revealed that male and female stegosaurus had different shaped plates running along their backs
Scientists have found that male stegosaurus -LRB- top -RRB- had different shaped armoured plates to females -LRB- bottom -RRB-
Some stegosaurus individuals have been found with wide plates while others had tall plates with
broader plates for use in mating displays while the females had the sharper taller plates
Stegosaurus -LRB- above -RRB- lived around 150 million years ago but scientists have been baffled by differences between the shape of the plates on some fossils
