unpaid suspension for Trooper Abraham Martinez last year but the footage only emerged this week as the Austin American Statesman investigated outdated tactics used in Department of Public Safety pursuits
Trooper Abraham Martinez is seen leaping into the air to kick Steven Gaydos after he fled from authorities in Houston in 2012 as he drove in
But troopers followed Gaydos for nearly 40 miles at speeds of 130 mph before Martinez pulled alongside him and fired four times through the window of his moving car
Martinez said he pulled out his weapon to avoid harm coming to anyone else on the road and only intended to shoot Gaydos
