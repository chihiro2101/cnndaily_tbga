Health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking
The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland
the Scottish Government 's health promotions agency
If introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in Scotland than it is in the rest of Britain
increase the minimum legal drinking age to 21 would be highly cost-effective
