The Southern Poverty Law Center in February filed
lawsuit against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond
The lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for Diamond 's gender dysphoria
but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition
but the personnel who do those screenings often are n't familiar with the condition
