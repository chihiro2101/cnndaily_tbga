Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as
he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years
interrupted of course by the Second World War
Carrick was hailed by Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney as
longer career since Matthews is goalkeeper Peter Shilton who played for England between 1971 and 1990
