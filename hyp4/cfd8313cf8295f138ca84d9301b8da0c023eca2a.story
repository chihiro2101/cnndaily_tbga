Villagers from Shandong Province in eastern China have reportedly resorted to transporting natural gas in plastic bags
Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws
This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong
An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers
