Mark O'Meara rolled back the years with one of the standout rounds of the day to make the cut at the Masters for the first time in 10 years
The 1998 champion was one over after the first round but five birdies in his second
behind Tom Watson -LRB- 65 -RRB- and Ben Crenshaw -LRB- 63 -RRB-
O'Meara is the third oldest man in the field in 2015
On that occasion he was level par for the first two rounds compared to three under this year
