-LRB- CNN -RRB- Five years after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history
we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions
The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented
I have been working with colleagues at Florida International University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill
Research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill
