The pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3 million social tenants was the centrepiece of Tuesday 's Tory manifesto launch
But housing associations responded furiously -- with one board member lambasting the proposal as the
housing association to sell their assets at less than they 're worth than you can force Tesco
The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all
because housing associations are generally prohibited from selling off their assets at below market value
