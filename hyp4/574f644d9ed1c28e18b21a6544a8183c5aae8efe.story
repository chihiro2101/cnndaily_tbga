Derby hero Jermain Defoe was lost for words as he tried to describe the emotion of scoring his stunning winner against Newcastle admitting he even had to question that it was even happening
The Sunderland hitman smashed home
and January signing Defoe will have good reason to remember it long after he has finally hung up his boots
Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was unable to do anything about Defoe 's 45th-minute strike
and Fletch was unbelievable because he played the number nine role up there on his own and me and Connor -LRB- Wickham -RRB- were just beside him
