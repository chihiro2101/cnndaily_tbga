Depraved Islamic State militants have deliberately destroyed hundreds of boxes of American-produced Halal chicken despite hundreds of thousands facing starvation in war-torn Syria
The barbaric terror group released photos show crates of chicken being set alight in
field near the city of Aleppo even though the meat being was slaughtered according to Islamic law and was perfectly fit for consumption
The food was burned after the jihadis noticed labels on the boxes that suggested the birds had been reared and slaughtered in the United States
