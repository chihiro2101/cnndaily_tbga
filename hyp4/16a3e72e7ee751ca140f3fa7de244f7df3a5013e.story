China -LRB- CNN -RRB- When China 's biggest auto show opens in Shanghai this week
will be the scantily-clad `` car babes '' that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event
which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for Chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world 's largest car market
while Ford will give two new luxury SUVs their China market debut -- the Lincoln MKX and Lincoln Navigator
It would be the first car made in China to hit U.S showrooms and may pave the way for Chinese brands to shake up the U.S. market like Japanese and Korean car manufacturers did decades earlier
