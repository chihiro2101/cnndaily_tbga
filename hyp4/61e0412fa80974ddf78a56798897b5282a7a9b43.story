says he will switch his lights on every evening in April for Autism Awareness Month
Mr Franklin 's 15-year-old son Bradley is autistic and the family want to use his Christmas light show to raise awareness for charities working with those with the disability
The 53-year-old father put the lights up on his council house last November in preparation for Christmas
But he did n't take them down in January because he wanted to switch the lights on again in April for Autism Awareness Month
am fed up of seeing your grotesque tacky council house Christmas lights
