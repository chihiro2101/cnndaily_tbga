Nestled in eastern Long Island is
sleepy little town called Yaphank where the streets have cozy names like Oak and Park
they once bore signs like Hitler and Goebbels Streets
Camp Siegfried was founded by the American Nazi group
join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down Hitler Street to salute American and Nazi flags
