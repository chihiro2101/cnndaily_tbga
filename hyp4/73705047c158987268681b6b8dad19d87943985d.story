Sportsmail 's Road to Rio cyclist Becky James is desperate to get back on to the track after her recent injuries
British cyclist James supported boyfriend George North during Wales
so in October we all sat down and decided the best thing was to send me to Bisham Abbey rehabilitation centre
there was the stress of being injured as well -- but my puppy Lola helped me with that
Though being at the Millennium Stadium for the opening loss to England was n't great -- you can imagine how my boyfriend George North took it
