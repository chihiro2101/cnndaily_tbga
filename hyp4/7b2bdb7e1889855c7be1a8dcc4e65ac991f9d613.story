Brendan Rodgers has killed off Lambert 's career and you 've got to feel sorry for the player
You ca n't blame him for joining Liverpool -- why would he turn that down
I 'm well aware Lambert is n't Luis Suarez
Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of Premier League minutes on the pitch Lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six-and-a-half games
Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool 's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa
