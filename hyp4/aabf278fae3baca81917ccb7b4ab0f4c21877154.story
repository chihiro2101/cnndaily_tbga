Crawford won the vacant WBO junior welterweight title with
knocking down Dulorme three times in quick fashion after that big blow
and the fight was stopped as Dulorme staggered against the ropes near his corner
' Crawford seemed measured in his approach the first two rounds against the quick-starting Dulorme
Dulorme was clearly the aggressor early against Crawford
