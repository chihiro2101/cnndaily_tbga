Bulgarians love their traditional music
sort of Bulgaria 's Got Talent for folk acts -- features people of all ages swaying in stately unison
they are so proud of the music that when asked to include something in the capsule aboard the Voyager
practically every village in the mountains has at least one choir
The autumnal colours shine on the Rodopi mountains in Bulgaria
