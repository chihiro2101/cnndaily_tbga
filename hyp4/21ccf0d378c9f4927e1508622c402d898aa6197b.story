Small businesses and restaurants will be forced to close over the Easter long weekend as they struggle to cover the costs of penalty rates on public holidays
Many operators across the country will face penalty rates of up to two-and-a-half times regular pay that would allow young workers to earn around
But the Australian Chamber of Commerce has launched
bid for small businesses to voice their concerns and call on the federal government to make changes to the penalty rates
The Too Big to Ignore campaign will allow small retailers and hospitality businesses to put up posters in their windows explaining why they are closed
