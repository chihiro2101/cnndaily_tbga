One house was filmed as it was carried along
A Dungog resident filmed the half-submerged property drifting down the main drag as floodwater laps at its sides on his smartphone
Similar scenes were evident in Lake Macquarie with this house floating along the waterway
Footage shows the house floating dangerously close to street power lines and almost taking them down with it
