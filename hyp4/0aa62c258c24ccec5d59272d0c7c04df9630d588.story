A young father who died in
paragliding accident on Monday afternoon posted pictures of his view from the sky just hours before he lost control of his powered paramotor
showing the beach and water far below his dangling feet
strong wind at approximately 3.30 pm on Monday afternoon
Family and friends were quick to post their condolences and memories of Mr Wittstock
