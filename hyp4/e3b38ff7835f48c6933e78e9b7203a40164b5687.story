Everyone knows the tortoise beat the hare
but this little fellow has gone one better and beaten two cheetahs
quick getaway under the watchful eye of one of the curious cheetahs
` While driving on the sandy tracks of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa
The tortoise continues his escape across the sands of the Kalahari desert in South Africa
