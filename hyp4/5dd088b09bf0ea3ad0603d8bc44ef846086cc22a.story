Pakistan was in the city 's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance
Mr Saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with
Atif Saeed crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground
the clicking sound of the camera 's shutter alerted the lion to Mr Saeed 's presence
