BBC TV documentary Ashya 's chances of long-term survival could have been halved by Brett and Naghmeh King 's decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here
said Ashya should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in Southampton last July
` We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is ... every month that goes by that he 's not getting chemotherapy
and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return
that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children .
