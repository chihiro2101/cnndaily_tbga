My introduction to Ferme de Montagne did not take place at this boutique hotel 's enviable ski-in
ski-out location in the French resort of Les Gets -- it happened at The Bar at The Dorchester in London
Ferme de Montagne proprietors Suzanne Dixon-Hudson and her architect husband Henry suggested we meet there for cocktails as they were in the capital
was impressed to discover that what Suzanne and Henry were really in town for was to check up on their 15 hotel staff -- who spend
chalet-style hotel where interaction with guests is integral to the Ferme de Montagne experience
