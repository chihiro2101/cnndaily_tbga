Miss Garrod had been wearing contact lenses since she was 15 with no problems
but woke up one day with an itchy and irritable right eye
Miss Garrod feared she would not be able to carry on with her photography degree due to going partially blind in one eye
Injuries can also be caused by contact lens being put in and removed from the eye
