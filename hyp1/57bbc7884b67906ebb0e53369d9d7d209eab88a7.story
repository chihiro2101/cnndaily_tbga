New York is set to officially break ground this week on
Ferris wheel that could become the tallest in the world once it is completed in early 2017
But any reign for the New York Wheel would be brief
in addition to other New York City boroughs and the neighbouring state of New Jersey
Planners for the New York Wheel said it will offer stunning panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline and other New York boroughs
