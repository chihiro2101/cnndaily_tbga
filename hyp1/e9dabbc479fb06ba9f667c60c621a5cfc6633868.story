Barry Bonds has been cleared legally after 11Â 1/2 years in court
His reputation remains tainted in the mind of many baseball fans
reversed the sole conviction against baseball slugger Barry Bonds
am humbled and truly thankful for the outcome as well as the opportunity our judicial system affords to all individuals to seek justice
' Bonds broke Hank Aaron 's long-standing career record of 755 homers in 2007
