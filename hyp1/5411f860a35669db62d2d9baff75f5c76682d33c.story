Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors
3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out
Tom Ince -LRB- centre -RRB- is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form
He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball
Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored
