spurious new survey which lists our supposedly favourite things
An example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy
Among the feel-good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap
Reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed
decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of
