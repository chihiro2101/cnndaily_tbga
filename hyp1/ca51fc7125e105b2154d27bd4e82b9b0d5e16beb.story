A white German Shepard puppy named Lt.Dan from South Carolina born without his paw now has
new friend who understands his unique struggle
On Monday the nine-week-old puppy was given to three-year-old Sapphyre Johnson who is missing both of her feet
named for the character in Forest Gump who lost his legs
Fellow breeders suggested to Riddle when Lt. Dan was born that he should be put down because he might be too sick to live
