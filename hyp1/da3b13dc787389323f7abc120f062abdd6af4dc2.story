Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim scored centuries as Bangladesh made 329 for six and Pakistan could only muster 250 in reply
Pakistan will have the chance to level the three-match series on Sunday when the second ODI takes place in Mirpur
Bangladesh elected to bat after winning the toss but struggled to 67 for two in the 20th over after Soumya Sarkar was run out by Wahab Riaz for 20 and Mahmudullah -LRB- five -RRB- was bowled by Rahat Ali
He continued to plunder runs with ease but went for one big shot too many against Wahab and was caught at mid-off to leave Bangladesh on 245 for three with nine overs left
