Michael Vaughan will become the most powerful man in English cricket if he is confirmed as Paul Downton 's successor at the helm of the national team
It emerged on Thursday that the former England captain has already held talks with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart
Yet Vaughan will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves have begun with Wednesday 's sacking of Downton as managing director
if the ECB are going to land the man who appears to be their first choice then they will have to make him
The exact terms of the new position were discussed at Thursday 's meeting of the ECB management board but if the director is to be Vaughan then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection
