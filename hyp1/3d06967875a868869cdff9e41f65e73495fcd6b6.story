new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by Neanderthals
living in south and west Europe and west Asia around 40,000 years ago
Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived Neanderthals
But the new study by Nagoya University and the University of Tokyo in Japan argues Neanderthals were just as well-equipped as their human counterparts
` Our new findings mean that the research community now needs to reconsider the assumption that our ancestors moved to Europe and succeeded where Neanderthals failed because of cultural and technological innovations brought from Africa or west Asia
