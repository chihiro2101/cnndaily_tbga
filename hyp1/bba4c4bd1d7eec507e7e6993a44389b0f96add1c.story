Do n't play H-O-R-S-E with this guy ... LeBron James has been able to do just about anything he wants during his team 's first three playoff games this season and that has apparently carried over to practice as well
James was at practice with his Cleveland Cavalier teammates on Saturday at the TD Garden in Boston before their game against the Celtics on Sunday afternoon
James decided to practice his long-range shooting
James flicked it overhand -LRB- right -RRB- while his teammates watched him shoot
but James Jones did seem as if he was trying to disrupt the former MVP 's concentration before the shot
