Hundreds of seals are being killed in British waters in order to protect stocks of salmon and other fish which are destined for supermarket shelves
meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead
Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England
This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie
