in the U.S. Southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States
near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona
To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air
New Mexico and Utah had the highest concentration of methane over background levels of any part of the United States
the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer -LRB- HyTES -RRB- will fly over suspected methane sources
