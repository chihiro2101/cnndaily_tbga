Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the Olympic Stadium
The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures
If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game -- 31 points from 17 matches -- they would now be fifth in the league
but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football
West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival
