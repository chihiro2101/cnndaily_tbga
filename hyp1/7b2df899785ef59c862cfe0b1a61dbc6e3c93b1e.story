A mum has come under fire for sending out invitations to her son 's first birthday in which she lists very specific requests for the boy
including some rather large and pricy gifts
other items that -LSB- retracted -RSB- would like for his birthday so that they can buy from their list and avoid duplication
` We 're asking for gifts only from grandparents and the direct aunt/uncle for -LSB- retracted -RSB- 's birthday party
