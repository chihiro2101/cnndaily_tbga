Kim Scott posted the poem on Saturday morning
Ms Scott 's sister describes their long-distance relationship while she lived in Wagga Wagga
26-year-old Ms Scott was due to marry her long-time partner Mr Woolley on Saturday
beautiful little sister on one of the happiest days in her life
Ms Scott at her hen 's party before she disappeared just six days before her wedding to Aaron Leeson-Woolley
