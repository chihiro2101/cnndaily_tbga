way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season
beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs
` They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they 're serious about finishing second
Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers
I still think Hibs are slightly ahead
