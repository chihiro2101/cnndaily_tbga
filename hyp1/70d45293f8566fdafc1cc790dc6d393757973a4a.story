It was the high point of their young careers
the Chelsea players took their turn to lift the UEFA Youth League trophy towards the cloudless Swiss sky
Their 3-2 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in Nyon meant another piece of silverware for the ever-expanding cabinet at Chelsea 's academy
It will be seen there as affirmation of the superiority of the Stamford Bridge production line
which they will put on the line against Manchester City next week in their fifth final in six seasons
