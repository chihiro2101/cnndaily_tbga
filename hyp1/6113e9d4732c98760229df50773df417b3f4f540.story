Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship
and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago
shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships
could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles
shot during his match against Ricky Walden during the Betfred World Championships .
