Defender Daryl Janmaat has admitted Newcastle got exactly what they deserved from their derby trip to Sunderland
The 25-year-old Holland full-back played the full 90 minutes of Sunday 's 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light despite suffering
but was unable to prevent the Black Cats running out winners as the Magpies slipped to

can say is we were not good enough and everybody saw that Sunderland were better
