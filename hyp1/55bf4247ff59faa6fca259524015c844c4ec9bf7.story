From identical shirts to shaving razors
a new website has exposed that Australian women are paying more than men for the same everyday consumer goods
Since campaigning group GetUp launched The Gender Price Gap website last week
members and everyday consumers have identified nine separate products that have identical female versions which cost more
This is despite the products being identical in almost every way except whether they are targeted towards women or men
