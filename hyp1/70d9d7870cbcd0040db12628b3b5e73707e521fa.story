dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions
An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time
more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime
` In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair
