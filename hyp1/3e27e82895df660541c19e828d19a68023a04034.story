England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice
here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor
after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park
The groundsmen placed sand on the crease but from the very next delivery Broad slipped and went crashing to the ground
