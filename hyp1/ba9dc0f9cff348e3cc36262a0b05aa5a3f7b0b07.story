I spoke to Carl Froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next
we were disappointed to see Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lose at the weekend against Andrzej Fonfara
result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of Froch and Chavez fighting in Las Vegas --
Now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what Carl does next
I have held talks with Gennady Golovkin 's manager and there is also the possibility of Bernard Hopkins
