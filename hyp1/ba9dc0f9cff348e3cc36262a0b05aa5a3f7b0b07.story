result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of Froch and Chavez fighting in Las Vegas --
Now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what Carl does next
Carl Froch -LRB- left -RRB- has not fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May
James DeGale -LRB- right -RRB- has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for Froch on his return
I can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight
