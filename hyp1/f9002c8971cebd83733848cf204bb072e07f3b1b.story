Spiders on Mars may have been predicted by David Bowie
but in fact spiders in space could help us get to the red planet
system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels
The system uses arachnid-like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the Earth or further into the Solar System
device will enable construction of large support structures for systems such as multi-hundred-kilowat solar arrays
