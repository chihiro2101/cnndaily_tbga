If you ever wanted to go to the Mad Hatter 's Tea Party or follow the white rabbit round
then you had best head to the south coast of England
with not one but two Alice in Wonderland themed houses to stay in
or alternatively try the snug Looking Glass Cottage with d√©cor inspired by the fantasy story
