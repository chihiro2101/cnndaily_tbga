Stan Collymore -LRB- third left -RRB- smashes home Liverpool 's fourth past Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek
Robbie Fowler -LRB- second right -RRB- rises above John Beresford to head home the opener for Liverpool
Fowler 's early goal began the seven goal spectacle that Martin Tyler classed as his favourite game
Strikes from Newcastle 's David Ginola and Faustino Asprilla either side of another from Fowler continued the goalfest and when Liverpool 's Stan Collymore drew both sides level with just over 20 minutes remaining the game was balanced on
