But Cole admits he 's in no position to ask his boss about an extension with Allardyce 's future also in limbo
the manager 's contract expires in the summer and it is looking increasingly likely he 'll leave West Ham
who came close to joining West Brom in January before Allardyce pulled the plug on the deal 20 minutes before the deadline after his attempts to sign Emmanuel Adebayor failed
Cole has not spoken to Sam Allardyce about his future because the West Ham boss does not know if he will be there next season
