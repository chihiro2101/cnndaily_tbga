remember traveling one day in the local train in Mumbai with my mother
my younger sister and brother
I continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces
the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss Rajendra Pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages
Her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in Pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
