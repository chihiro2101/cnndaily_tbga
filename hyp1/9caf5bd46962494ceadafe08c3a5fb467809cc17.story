was spotted breaking away from West Antarctica 's Getz Ice Shelf by the U.S. National Ice Center -LRB- NIC -RRB-
17 miles -LRB- 27km -RRB- long iceberg being born in the West Antarctica 's Getz Ice Shelf
Glaciers in the Amundsen Sea of west Antarctica are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels
They are interested in this because the ice floating around Antarctica has thinned by nearly 20 percent
Ice barriers have an average thickness of between 400 to 500 meters -LRB- 1,300 to 1,600 feet -RRB- and can extend hundreds of kilometers off the coast of Antarctica
