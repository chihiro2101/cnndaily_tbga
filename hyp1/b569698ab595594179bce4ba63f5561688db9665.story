Given Manny Pacquiao is on his show next week it 's just as well Jimmy Kimmel did n't offend the Filipino fighter with his rendition of his inspirational ballad Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino
On his show Jimmy Kimmel Live the comedian sang an excerpt of the song
an earnest work dedicated to Pacquiao 's fellow Filipinos and with footage after the devastating Typhoon Haiyan in the video
Kimmel 's sidekick Manuel sways to Kimmel also as he sings the song dedicated to the Filipino people
The likelihood Kimmel 's viewers will hear the song as Pacquiao intended it next week is high given his was the first US talk show the boxer ever appeared on back in 2009
