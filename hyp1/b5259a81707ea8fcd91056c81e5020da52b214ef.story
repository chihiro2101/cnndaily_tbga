horrific plane crash that claimed the lives of nearly 80 babies and children 40 years ago has made an emotional return to the scene of one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the Vietnam War
Landon has visited the crash scene and is thought to be the first child survivor to return to the countryside on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City where the C-5 military cargo plane crashed and broke up killing 78 children and 50 adults on April
Landon and Lorie Carnie were thought to have died when the first flight of Operation Babylift -- an evacuation of Vietnamese orphans and children before the Fall of Saigon -- crashed minutes after take-off
Landon and his sister had at first been placed on the lower cargo deck of the plane where they would almost certainly have died before
' Landon 's twin sister Lorie visited Vietnam in 2005 but it was only years later that Landon discovered the scene of the crash in which they were presumed to have died
