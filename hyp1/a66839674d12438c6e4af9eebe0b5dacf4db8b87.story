jagged shapes of light origami designed to trick the mind
and forests of floating white dresses are just some of the magical installations coming to this year 's Vivid Sydney festival
Each winter since 2009 the city has come alight with mind-bending light shows projected onto iconic buildings such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge
glowing swings with the Sydney Harbour Bridge as the backdrop and the sails of the Opera House lit up again
These vibrant apparatus will stand out against the backdrop of the illuminated Sydney Harbour Bridge
