This bundle of joy was
special spring surprise for both his mother and the farmers who delivered the 20lb new-born after
team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray
Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him
Ben is n't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered
