everything pointed to another humiliating English defeat in Dublin
way back into the contest for the West Countrymen
The England No 10 's solo-try was the only score that the West Country outfit managed to register in the first-half
penalty conceded by replacement Matt Garvey with seconds on the clock
lot better than we showed today
