it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem
The trouble is that little of our foreign military financing -- including the recent Counterterrorism Partnership Funds -- goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism
the United States is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long-term investment in special operations units in key partner nations
The reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare
But with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement
