Brendan Rodgers has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities
insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage Liverpool under the Fenway Sports Group model
difficult week for Rodgers
But Rodgers has not been rattled by the intensity of the criticism nor is he dwelling on the disappointment
I will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they -LRB- FSG -RRB- want
