'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer
find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body
I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement
however -- if we 're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott 's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department
