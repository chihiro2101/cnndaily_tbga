West Brom manager Tony Pulis will receive
hero 's welcome when he returns to Crystal Palace on Saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57-year-old
For all the expertise Pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight
a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of Stoke City and Palace supporters
He turned Palace 's season around 12 months ago and is still favoured to keep Albion up this time
