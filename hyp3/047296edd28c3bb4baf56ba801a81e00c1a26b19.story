All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body
The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells are n't working
Mice born without both of them became obese -- as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated
