England 's top three are exceptional players but the issue is that they are very one-paced and when the West Indies bowling was so disciplined
appreciate the need to entertain as well and the way the top three go about things might become
Joe Root -LRB- left -RRB- and Ian Bell -LRB- right -RRB- put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in Antigua
if they stay in the runs will come and England supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that England have promised to play
