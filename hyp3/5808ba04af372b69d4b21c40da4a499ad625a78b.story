set foot on my terrace overlooking the scenic Douro river to the divine meal
a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar
In those five years it has been hitting all the right notes
When guests arrive at The Yeatman they set foot in
which has impressive views across the river of Portugal 's second-largest city
