It may an unorthodox way of achieving European qualification
but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce would welcome doing so through UEFA 's Respect and Fair Play rankings
The top three nations in UEFA 's rankings qualify for the Europa League
West Ham have little left to play for as they sit ninth ahead of Saturday 's match with bottom-club Leicester City at the King Power Stadium
Yet they could achieve European qualification regardless of where they end up in the Premier League by finishing top of the Fair Play table
