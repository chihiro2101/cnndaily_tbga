It may an unorthodox way of achieving European qualification
but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce would welcome doing so through UEFA 's Respect and Fair Play rankings
with England currently sitting third and West Ham topping the Barclays Premier League 's Fair Play table
West Ham have little left to play for as they sit ninth ahead of Saturday 's match with bottom-club Leicester City at the King Power Stadium
Allardyce led Bolton Wanderers into UEFA Cup qualification for the first time in the club 's history in 2005
