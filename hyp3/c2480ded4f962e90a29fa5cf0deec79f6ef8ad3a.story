-LRB- CNN -RRB- In the beginning ... there was the Bible
But this Catholic had n't read it -- at least
I have never read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation
My excuse always has been that Catholics have their Bible passages read to them at Mass every Sunday
beautiful Bible that has traveled with me from Vermont to Montreal to Atlanta and finally to Washington
