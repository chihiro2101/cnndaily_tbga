We were told by Mooresey -LSB- coach Peter Moores -RSB- that Paul had been let go between sessions in the practice game against Saint Kitts
think Straussy -LSB- Andrew Strauss -RSB- was considered last time the role came up
Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart are all former England captains who would all bring their own experience and knowledge to the role
We needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like Cooky and Trotty -LSB- Jonathan Trott -RSB- back into the group will help that
I think we 're third behind Waqar -LSB- Younis -RSB- and Wasim -LSB- Akram -RSB- and Curtly -LSB- Ambrose -RSB- and Courtney -LSB- Walsh -RSB- as
