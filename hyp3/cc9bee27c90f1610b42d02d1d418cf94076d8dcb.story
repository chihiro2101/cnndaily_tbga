Manchester United had four different scorers On Sunday
do n't think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team
With all that money flashing around you would have picked Angel di Maria over Juan Mata
Marouane Fellaini has become Manchester United 's go-to player in midfielder this season
who would have thought he would become one of United 's most consistent players
