Love the lighting in these photography shots
They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they 're paintings
The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it 's impossible to tell apart from
The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits
Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots
