The common ancestor of humans may have had tentacles
A Russian scientist says the distant ancestor of humans had tentacles
They lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food
The latest research was conducted by Dr Elena Temereva from the Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Faculty of Biology of the Lomonosov Moscow State University
A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago
