Goodness knows how many times at White Hart Lane
've felt like falling to my knees at the back of the West Stand and banging my head on the floor
'd have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit
to see that photograph of two Muslim Liverpool supporters praying to Mecca at half-time in an FA Cup match
And Scousers go to Anfield to worship at the shrine of Shankly
