major part in Pep Guardiola 's contract discussions with Bayern Munich
Pep Guardiola is set to enter into contract negotiations with Bayern Munich at the end of the season
The Spaniard has been linked strongly with Manchester City in the past but Dreesen believes Guardiola will not base his decision on where he will earn the most money
` Pep is not the type of coach who is trying to make as much money as possible
` He could already have made much more money elsewhere when he joined Bayern
