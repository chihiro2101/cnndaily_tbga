, St George 's Day takes place on April 23 every year
local St George 's Day Parade with residents watching on
Temperatures were slightly warmer across England today than on St George 's Day last year
The parade in Nottingham was organised by the Royal Society of St George
I 'm more interested in what St George 's Day can represent
