significant impact on the runway but an exclusively Aboriginal modelling agency is in the swing of changing that cultural fashion landscape
The first name that comes to mind when thinking of Aboriginal models for even the most die-hard of fashionistas is Samantha Harris who was one of the most prominent faces during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia in Sydney this week
The only other indigenous face to join the 24-year-old stunner at the biggest week on the country 's fashion calendar over the past two years is Lauren Feenstra
The agency started off with just five models and now has 40 including Noreen Carr -LRB- pictured -RRB-
Dargin says the high fashion market is slowly changing its perspective when it comes to indigenous models but she hoped it would move along more quickly -LRB- Cheyanne Fuller pictured -RRB-
