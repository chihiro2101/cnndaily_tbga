Hillary Clinton 's family 's charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments
omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue
the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors
The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years
the foundation said it would only continue to receive donations from six countries that are already supporting ongoing projects
