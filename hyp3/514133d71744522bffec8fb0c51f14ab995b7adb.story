It was once the edgiest place in town
but 30 years later Cleveland 's Variety Theater is silent
gig so loud it literally began to bring the house down
As the crowd went wild over the group 's unique ear-shattering brand of music
the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience
