I can remember players left out when
moan in the dressing room and spouting nonsense about how they did not fit in
Joe Root showed plenty of grit
bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young English batsman to watch out for was Joe Root
His fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best
