It is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and Joe Root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year 's Sydney Test
I can remember players left out when
bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young English batsman to watch out for was Joe Root
for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke
