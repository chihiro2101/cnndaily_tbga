It probably wo n't be enough to surpass Bill Buckner in Boston sports lore
A wicked mistake in the men 's college hockey title game on Saturday by Boston University 's goalie allowed Providence to tie in the third period and paved the way for the Friars to win their first title
will always be remembered for the game-tying goal allowed by BU 's Matt O'Connor
Providence defenseman Tom Parisi dumped the puck towards the BU goal from near center ice
It was the Providence 's first NCAA hockey title and third straight year
