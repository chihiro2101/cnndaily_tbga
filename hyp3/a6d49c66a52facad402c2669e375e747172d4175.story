It probably wo n't be enough to surpass Bill Buckner in Boston sports lore
which ended 4-3 and was played at the TD Garden in Boston
will always be remembered for the game-tying goal allowed by BU 's Matt O'Connor
Matt O'Connor 's own-goal turned his team 's 3-2 lead into
Providence defenseman Tom Parisi dumped the puck towards the BU goal from near center ice
