Should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children
and feel that TV junk food adverts make it difficult to help their children eat
children in the UK are still being exposed to more TV advertising for unhealthy than healthy food items
Reducing TV advertising to children as the British Heart Foundation are suggesting
of course reduce the number of junk food advertisements children see
