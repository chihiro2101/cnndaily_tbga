Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the Bradford City fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify
new inquiry into the disaster
A new book claims that the fire at Valley Parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club 's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham
in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident
Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham -LRB- left -RRB- with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand
