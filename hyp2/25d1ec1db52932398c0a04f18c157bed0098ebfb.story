Holmesburg Prison 's 101-year history was filled with violent riots
its high walls housed some of the country 's most dangerous criminals whose uprisings ended in death and mass-injury
And haunting images published in 2011 proved that government doctors used the jail in Philadelphia
But Kligman 's distinguished career was tarnished by accusations of human cruelty inside Holmesburg prison that inspired federal restrictions on human testing
terrifying legacy that it has since been used as the set of violent prison movies such as Animal Factory in 2000 and Law Abiding Citizen starring Gerard Butler in 2009
