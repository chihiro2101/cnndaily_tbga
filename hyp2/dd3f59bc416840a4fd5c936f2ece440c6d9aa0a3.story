Superior Court Judge Carl Taylor in Middletown
denied requests made last month by attorneys for both Cassandra and her mother
The judge ruled on Wednesday she must remain in DCF custody until completing court-ordered chemotherapy for Hodgkin 's lymphoma
Cassandra Fortin was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to undergo cancer treatment
The state agency last fall won temporary custody of Cassandra after she and her mother argued she did not want chemo treatments despite the risk of dying without them
