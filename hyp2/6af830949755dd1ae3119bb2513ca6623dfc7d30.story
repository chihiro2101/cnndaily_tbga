Shannen Hussein may just have one of the largest collections of pets in Australia
34 kilometres north-west of Melbourne
from her lamb Winter who loves to jump on the bed to her bearded dragon who can understand the English language
Winter also runs across the yard to Ms Hussein when he 's called
and Ozzie the emu which used to live on the farm liked to chase sheep
