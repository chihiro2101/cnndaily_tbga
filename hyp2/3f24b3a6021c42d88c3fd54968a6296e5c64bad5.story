Smartphones often overheat if they 're held close to the body or are used for long periods of time
And while the dangers of overheating lithium ion -LRB- Li-ion -RRB- batteries have been known for some time
Thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085 °C -LRB- 1,985 °F -RRB- causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent
It was filmed by Paul Shearing from University College London and the findings are published in the journal Nature Communications
This occurs when the rate of heat generated in the cell is greater than the rate of heat lost
