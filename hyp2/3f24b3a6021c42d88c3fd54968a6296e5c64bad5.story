Smartphones often overheat if they 're held close to the body or are used for long periods of time
And while the dangers of overheating lithium ion -LRB- Li-ion -RRB- batteries have been known for some time
Researchers subjected Lithium-ion batteries to heat and used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe changes in their internal structure
indicating temperatures of at least 1,085 °C -LRB- 1,985 °F -RRB-
It was filmed by Paul Shearing from University College London and the findings are published in the journal Nature Communications
