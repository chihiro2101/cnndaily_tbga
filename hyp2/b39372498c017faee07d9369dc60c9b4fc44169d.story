B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people -- including details about their pension pots
The second firm -- Data Bubble -- supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients -- such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure
The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data
We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly
