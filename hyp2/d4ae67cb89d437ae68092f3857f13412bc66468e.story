Barely out of nappies
this five-year-old boy was not the most likely candidate to take on six heavily armed troops
from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank
The boy 's stone attack came as violence erupted on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day
The Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the West Bank city of Nablus
