For the first time in 65 years the California Department of Water Resources has found no snow during its manual survey of the land at 6,800 feet in the Sierra Nevada in early April
which found the lowest water level in the Sierra Nevada snowpack since 1950 when records began
The fourth consecutive year of vanishing snow spells trouble as California depends on it to melt into rivers and replenish reservoirs
