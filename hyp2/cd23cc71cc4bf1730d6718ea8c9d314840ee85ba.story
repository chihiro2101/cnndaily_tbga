The cyclone strength winds currently battering the NSW coast are being caused by an intense low-pressure system known as an East Coast Low
East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter
This one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one
Powerful winds on Monday night and Tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding -LRB- right -RRB- in Edgecliff
Winds of at least 100km/h lashed parts of the east coast
