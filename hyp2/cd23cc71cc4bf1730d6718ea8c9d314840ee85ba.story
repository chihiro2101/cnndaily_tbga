The stormy weather system
has n't hit NSW this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever
East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter
But this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm
Some have speculated this week 's East Coast Low will be the worst in five years
