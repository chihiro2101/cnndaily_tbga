Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building
The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be the same as the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement
A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to 200 million pounds
But Johnson said police were still identifying the owners of the ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost
Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination
