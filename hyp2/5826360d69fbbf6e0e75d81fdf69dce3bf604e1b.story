The Duchess of Cambridge has the power to send sales of high-street designs sky-rocketing
so it 's little surprise that her offspring have the same effect
anything that the second-born touches will turn to gold and copycat designs will bring
Anything Prince George has been seen wearing has gone on to sell out
which will be great for the people who designed her clothes or those who can make quick knock-off copies
