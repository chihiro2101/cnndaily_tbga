James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from
uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real
James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall
As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen
The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck
