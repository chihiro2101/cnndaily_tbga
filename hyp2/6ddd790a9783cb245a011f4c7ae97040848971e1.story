it 's the biggest bogan in Straya
This is the image of the Big Bogan statue that the Bogan Shire Council is aiming to erect in the town of Nyngan to honour the Aussie icon
The man behind it all is Graeme Burke who is the manager of engineering services for the council and this is his design for the statue
` Where better in Australia could we have `` The Big Bogan '' than on the banks of the Bogan River
would like to see it located on the eastern side of the Peter Sinclair Bridge opposite the Tritton Mine Village
