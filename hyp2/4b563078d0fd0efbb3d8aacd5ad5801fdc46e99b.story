It 's usually children who are seen splashing away in spray fountains
But one dog was caught lapping up all the fun at
public play area in Brooklyn
Lihi Yona filmed the black pup enthusiastically jumping around in time to the squirts of water
His bemused owner can be seen standing at the sidelines holding on to the pup 's leash
