Two birds of prey have been caught on camera brutally fighting over
staring each other down before attacking each other with sharp talons and beaks
And despite the owl 's cuddly reputation
The fight was captured on video by wildlife photographer Robert Fuller
The cameras were set up as part of an exhibition at Mr Fuller 's gallery
