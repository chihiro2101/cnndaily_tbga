Congratulations to Australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas
It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react
Stuart Lancaster must be free to pick his best players
If Roy Hodgson 's star names moved to Bayern Munich or Barcelona
