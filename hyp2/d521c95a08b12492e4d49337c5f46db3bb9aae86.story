Congratulations to Australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas
It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react
Stuart Lancaster must be free to pick his best players
Matt Giteau 's stellar displays for Toulon have put him back on the Wallabies radar ahead of the World Cup
The World Cup is simply about the world 's best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it
