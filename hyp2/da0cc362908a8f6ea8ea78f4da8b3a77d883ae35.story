Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur missed out on the opportunity to narrow the gap to Under 21 league leaders Manchester United after playing out
Spurs went into the game at Staines Town sitting sixth in the league but victory would have taken them joint top with the Red Devils
while the defending champions were only three points behind the north London outfit
Ruben Loftus-Cheek played for Chelsea Under 21s having already starred in the Champions League this term
