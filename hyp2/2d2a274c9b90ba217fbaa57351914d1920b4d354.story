Odds on the second royal baby being called Sam have been slashed
Prince George 's brother or sister could be called Sam
It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge 's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend
` Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby 's name
The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month
