Gareth Bale left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after Diego Godin 's slip
Bale will not find too much consolation in the fact that he linked well with Ronaldo in the first half
Bale attacked at will and he looked for Ronaldo with his crosses as the Portuguese found himself in centre-forward territory regularly throughout the first 45 minutes
Both Bale and Ronaldo scored in extra-time in Lisbon and only an incredible performance from Jan Oblak prevented them from doing so in the first half
although Bale was allowed to run over one -- and in fairness to Ronaldo all the set-pieces were awarded on Ronaldo 's favoured left-side of the penalty area
