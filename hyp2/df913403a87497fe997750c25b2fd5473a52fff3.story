If you decided to stay in Britain for the school holidays rather than jetting off abroad
Because the glorious spring weather is set to stretch out for the rest of the week
and the weather will be warmer here than in many Mediterranean sun spots
The mercury is set to rise steadily until Friday
corridor of flowers yesterday as they enjoy the warm weather at Cliveden House in Maidenhead
