There will be calls for England to get rid of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott on the back of their failures here but
think they should both play all three Tests against West Indies before any sort of decision is made
We are talking about two batsmen with phenomenal Test records who have done it against Australia in the past and
Jonathan Trott -LRB- left -RRB- and Alastair Cook head out to open England 's second innings against West Indies
and Cook has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his Test career
