Brave Finley Lamb suffers from rare brain abnormality Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia
The centre treats children with special needs and developmental delays and suggested special exercises and lifestyle changes intended to stimulate Finley 's brain
Finley was diagnosed with PVNH when he was two years old
` It is hard to think what he would be like had we not found the Family Hope Center and he still was n't able to walk or talk
I think he will have another year or two left on the programme then he should be finished
