A lonely shepherd has been found dead alongside
scarecrow he had apparently had sex with after dressing it up in
The rotting remains of Jose Alberto
were discovered after neighbours called their local council to report the smell coming from his house in the city of San Jose de Balcare in eastern Argentina
` There were no signs of violence and we are working on the assumption that the man died during sex with the scarecrow
