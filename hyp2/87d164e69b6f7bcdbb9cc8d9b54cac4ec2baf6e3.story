Probably the most extraordinary thing about the island of St Helena is that it was ever found at all
A tiny ten by six mile speck in the South Atlantic 1,200 miles from the coast of West Africa
discovered by in 1502 by Juan de Nova
And it was the place to which Napoleon was exiled after his defeat at Waterloo
