Whilst overseas backpackers visiting Sydney beaches are often told to go back to where they came from
Sutherland Council is instead exploring the idea of allowing them to camp right on the beach
Among these locations are Cronulla beach and Wanda beach
This motion was proposed by Councillor Steve Simpson due to the economic boost the backpackers bring
Sutherland Mayor Kent Johns is keen to attract more tourists but keep away those who act in an unwelcome manner
