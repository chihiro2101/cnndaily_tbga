Raheem Sterling could force his way out of Liverpool this summer
Under Premier League regulations the 20-year-old is entitled to

The effect of that would see the fee Liverpool could command for the forward dramatically reduce
the stalemate between Sterling and Liverpool does not seem to have affected his performances too much
