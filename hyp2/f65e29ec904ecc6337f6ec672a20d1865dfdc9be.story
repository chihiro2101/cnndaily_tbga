holiday it is easy to be confused when it turns out your flight to Vancouver in Canada goes to airport code YVR
at an airport with the code AGP
While many main airports have codes which make sense
such as JFK for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York
From unfortunate codes such as OMG and SUX to the funny LOL
