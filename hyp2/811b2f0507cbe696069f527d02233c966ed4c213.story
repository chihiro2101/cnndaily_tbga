Paul Casey insists he is desperate to play in the Ryder Cup again
even though he looks unlikely to rejoin the European Tour in time to earn qualifying points this season
Only Tour members can play on the team and Phoenix-based Casey gave up his membership after deciding in January to concentrate on the PGA Tour in order to get back into the world 's top 50
Casey last played in the Ryder Cup competition in the 2008 defeat by USA at Valhalla
